              docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with  
            the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files  
            and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a         
            `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the    
            last edit made to the file at `path`                                                                                                      
            Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original 
            file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure 
            to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the
            `old_str`

            - Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.                                       
            - Code with incorrect indentation will fail.                                                                                              
            - You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.                        
            - If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello,   
            World!")', you should use the command:

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the   
            special interface commands.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                                                                  
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues   
            are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this.                                          
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a    
            different directory.                                                                                                                      
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                                                                   
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                                                                      
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.  
                                                                                                                                                      
            WORKFLOW:                                                                                                                                 
            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                                                           
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.     
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.\nRemember, the commands are limited to bash or special     
            interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.\n\n1. You should show only one observation and ACTION 
            ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. \n2. You need to action the command, not  
            only disscuss it.\n3. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.\n4. If you receive

            you want to edit.\n   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, 
            remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context\n5. Remember which are the allowed commands and  
            how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).\n7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the    
            previous steps.\n8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. \n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then 
            wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section  
            will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just 
            the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash

            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.

Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            **Corrected Code:**                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Command:**                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                      
            There is no need to execute any commands in this case. The code fix is provided.
