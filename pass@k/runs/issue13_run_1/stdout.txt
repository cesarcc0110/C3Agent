            You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs  
            and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.                   
            You will be working in a command line with a special interface that    
            allows you to edit files directly.                                     
                                                                                   
            The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines  
            of a file at a time.                                                   
            You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g.,      
            python, vim).                                                          
            In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following   
            commands to help you navigate and edit files.

              docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing     
            files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with  
            the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying 
            `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and  
            directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used  
            if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command`      
            generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with          
            `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last    
            edit made to the file at `path`                                        
            Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter   
            should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original   
            file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not   
            unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to
            include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str`  
            parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the      
            `old_str`

            number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to

            - Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must
            include all spaces exactly.                                            
            - Code with incorrect indentation will fail.                           
            - You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue   
            described in the PR, do not create new files.                          
            - If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with 
            the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello,       
            World!")', you should use the command:

            The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

            Incorrect final stack size check in Valid Parentheses solution         
            The C++ implementation incorrectly checks if the stack size is exactly 
            1 at the end to determine validity. The correct condition is that the  
            stack should be empty.                                                 
                                                                                   
            File: ValidParentheses.cpp

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your
            task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special
            interface commands.                                                    
                                                                                   
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                               
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code      
            relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues  
            are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you   
            can use to accomplish this.                                            
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to 
            confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a        
            different directory.                                                   
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well   
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you    
            need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need 
            editing.                                                               
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're      
            editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.    
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.              
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to    
            finalize your changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to       
            carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a         
            decission that solve the error.                                        
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect
            on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a    
            command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface        
            commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be    
            used.                                                                  
                                                                                   
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME,
            the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous      
            command.                                                               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.               
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous       
            command before running a new one.                                      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it  
            means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing 
            is not the one you want to edit.                                       
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the      
            correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are   
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the       
            context                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no     
            interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps. 
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                              
                                                                                   
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and  
            then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more    
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
            section will be saved for future reference.                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!    
            Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after     
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.       
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
            cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.         
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to       
            carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a         
            decission that solve the error.                                        
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect
            on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a    
            command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface        
            commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be    
            used.                                                                  
                                                                                   
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME,
            the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous      
            command.                                                               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.               
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous       
            command before running a new one.                                      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it  
            means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing 
            is not the one you want to edit.                                       
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the      
            correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are   
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the       
            context                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no     
            interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps. 
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                              
                                                                                   
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and  
            then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more    
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
            section will be saved for future reference.                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!    
            Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after     
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.       
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
            cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.         
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands 
            (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                      
                                                                                   
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous     
            command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to       
            carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a         
            decission that solve the error.                                        
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect
            on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a    
            command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface        
            commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be    
            used.                                                                  
                                                                                   
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME,
            the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous      
            command.                                                               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.               
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous       
            command before running a new one.                                      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it  
            means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing 
            is not the one you want to edit.                                       
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the      
            correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are   
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the       
            context                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no     
            interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps. 
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                              
                                                                                   
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and  
            then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more    
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
            section will be saved for future reference.                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!    
            Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after     
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.       
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
            cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.         
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands 
            (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                      
                                                                                   
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous     
            command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            The `isValid()` function contains a bug in the final comparison. It    
            should be `return stk.size() == 0;`, not `return stk.size() == 1;`.    
            This will correctly check if the stack is empty, indicating a balanced 
            parentheses expression.

            comparison issue.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to       
            carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a         
            decission that solve the error.                                        
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect
            on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a    
            command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface        
            commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be    
            used.                                                                  
                                                                                   
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME,
            the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous      
            command.                                                               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.               
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous       
            command before running a new one.                                      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it  
            means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing 
            is not the one you want to edit.                                       
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the      
            correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are   
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the       
            context                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no     
            interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps. 
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                              
                                                                                   
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and  
            then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more    
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
            section will be saved for future reference.                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!    
            Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after     
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.       
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
            cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.         
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands 
            (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                      
                                                                                   
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous     
            command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.                                                          
            OBSERVATION:

            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
            cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.         
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to       
            carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a         
            decission that solve the error.                                        
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect
            on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a    
            command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface        
            commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be    
            used.                                                                  
                                                                                   
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME,
            the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous      
            command.                                                               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.               
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous       
            command before running a new one.                                      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it  
            means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing 
            is not the one you want to edit.                                       
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the      
            correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are   
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the       
            context                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no     
            interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps. 
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                              
                                                                                   
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and  
            then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more    
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
            section will be saved for future reference.                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!    
            Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after     
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.       
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
            cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to       
            carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a         
            decission that solve the error.                                        
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect
            on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a    
            command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface        
            commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be    
            used.                                                                  
                                                                                   
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME,
            the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous      
            command.                                                               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.               
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous       
            command before running a new one.                                      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it  
            means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing 
            is not the one you want to edit.                                       
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the      
            correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are   
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the       
            context                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no     
            interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps. 
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                              
                                                                                   
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and  
            then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more    
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION      
            section will be saved for future reference.                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT!    
            Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after     
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.       
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep,  
            cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.         
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands 
            (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                      
                                                                                   
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous     
            command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.
