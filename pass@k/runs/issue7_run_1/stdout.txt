            - Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.

            - If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface        
            commands.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                                                                                         
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files,   
            there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this.                                                                                        
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory.      
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                                                                                          
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                                                                                             
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            WORKFLOW:                                                                                                                                                        
            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                                                                                  
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.                            
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.                                                                                                        
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                             
            REMINDERS:                                                                                                                                                       
            - Run one command at a time.                                                                                                                                     
            - Wait for feedback after each command.                                                                                                                          
            - Do not use git or interactive tools.                                                                                                                           
            - Use absolute paths when referencing files.                                                                                                                     
            - If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.                                                                                  
            - Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            - The path `/HeberM69__Test_C3/justNum.java` is an absolute path.                                                                                                
            - The code to calculate the sum of `num1` and `num2` has been added to the file.                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Verification:**                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                             
            After running the command, verify that the code has been added to the file using the following command:                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Additional Notes:**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Ensure that the syntax for the sum calculation is correct.                                                                                                     
            - The code should be tested to ensure that it produces the expected result.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Further Actions:**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Compile and run the Java code to ensure it executes without errors.                                                                                            
            - Test the code with different input values.                                                                                                                     
            - Refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            **Additional Notes:**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Ensure that the syntax for the sum calculation is correct.                                                                                                     
            - The code should be tested to ensure that it produces the expected result.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Further Actions:**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Compile and run the Java code to ensure it executes without errors.                                                                                            
            - Test the code with different input values.                                                                                                                     
            - Refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            **Additional Notes:**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Ensure that the syntax for the sum calculation is correct.                                                                                                     
            - The code should be tested to ensure that it produces the expected result.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Further Actions:**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Compile and run the Java code to ensure it executes without errors.                                                                                            
            - Test the code with different input values.                                                                                                                     
            - Refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            After running the command, verify that the code has been added to the file using the following command:                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Additional Notes:**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Ensure that the syntax for the sum calculation is correct.                                                                                                     
            - The code should be tested to ensure that it produces the expected result.                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Further Actions:**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Compile and run the Java code to ensure it executes without errors.                                                                                            
            - Test the code with different input values.                                                                                                                     
            - Refactor the code to improve its readability and maintainability.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            **Note:**                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - The provided path `/HeberM69__Test_C3/justNum.java` should be accurate depending on where your Java file is located.                                           
            - The code inserts a new line `int sum = num1 + num2;` into the designated location within the Java file.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Verification:**                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                             
            After running the command, verify that the code has been added to the file by running the following command:                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Additional Notes:**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Ensure the syntax for calculating the sum is correct.                                                                                                          
            - Test the code to ensure it functions as intended.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Further Actions:**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Compile and run the Java code to execute the sum calculation.                                                                                                  
            - Test with different input values for `num1` and `num2`.                                                                                                        
            - Refactor the code for improved readability and maintainability.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            - Ensure the syntax for calculating the sum is correct.                                                                                                          
            - Test the code to ensure it functions as intended.                                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Further Actions:**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Compile and run the Java code to execute the sum calculation.                                                                                                  
            - Test with different input values for `num1` and `num2`.                                                                                                        
            - Refactor the code for improved readability and maintainability.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            **Verification:**                                                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                                             
            After installation, run the following command to check if Java is installed correctly:                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Additional Notes:**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Java is a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and Java Development Kit (JDK) that is used to run Java programs.                                                         
            - Java is a powerful object-oriented programming language that is widely used in web applications, mobile applications, and other software.                      
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Further Actions:**                                                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - Once Java is installed, update your code to use the `java` command to run your Java program.                                                                   
            - Test your Java program with different input values.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you

               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing

            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

            The user is unable to run their Java program due to a missing `sudo` command. This is because the user did not run the `sudo` command before running the         
            `apt-get` command to install Java.                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Additional Notes:**                                                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                                                                             
            - The user needs to run the `sudo` command before running the `apt-get` command.                                                                                 
            - The `sudo` command grants the user temporary administrative privileges.

            ### User:                                                                                                                                                        
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            3. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            4. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            6. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            7. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.

Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.

               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.

            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            * The user may need to use a different repository depending on their operating system and distribution.                                                          
            * The specific JDK version may vary depending on the user's needs.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                                             
            **Next Steps:**                                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Once the repository is added and the package is installed, the user can run the command `java -version` to verify installation.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your

            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

            script presented in the discussion demonstrates a structured approach to troubleshooting and resolving issues. The user effectively breaks down the task into    
            smaller steps, analyzes the output of each command, and adjusts their strategy accordingly.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* **Structured approach:** The script outlines a
            clear sequence of actions, from identifying potential errors to attempting alternative installation methods.\n* **Command analysis:** The user correctly analyzes
            the output of each command to determine whether the installation was successful or encountered errors.\n* **Discussion and planning:** The user considers the    
            installation options and develops a discussion about the best course of action.\n\n**Areas for improvement:**\n\n* **Error handling:** The script does not       
            explicitly handle errors that might arise during the installation process. The user should add error checks to address unexpected situations.\n* **Feedback:**   
            The script could provide more informative feedback to the user about the progress and results of each command.\n* **Documentation:** The user should document the
            installation process for future reference and troubleshooting.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n\n* Add error handling using `try`/`catch` blocks to address 
            potential errors during installation.\n* Include feedback messages to provide user with information about the progress and results of each command.\n* Create a  
            documentation file to record the installation process, including instructions, commands, and troubleshooting tips.\n\n**Overall, the script demonstrates a good  
            understanding of the installation process and problem-solving skills. With some refinement and additional features, the script can be even more efficient and
