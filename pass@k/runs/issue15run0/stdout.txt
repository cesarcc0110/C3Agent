            applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2      
            levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If 
            a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The

            consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not
            unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in       
            `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should

            The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

            Off-by-one error in countPrimes due to unnecessary subtraction                                          
            The Java implementation incorrectly subtracts 1 from the final count of prime numbers, which causes the 
            function to return an off-by-one result. The subtraction is unnecessary because the count is already    
            accurate after summing true values in the isPrime array.

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue    
            described above using bash and the special interface commands.                                          
                                                                                                                    
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                                
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This
            is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can 
            use to accomplish this.                                                                                 
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If
            you need, use cd to move to a different directory.                                                      
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                                 
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                                    
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or      
            locate the file where the problem is.

            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                         
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to 
            change directories if needed.                                                                           
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.                                               
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

            - Wait for feedback after each command.                                                                 
            - Do NOT use git or interactive tools.

            - Use absolute paths when referencing files.                                                            
            - If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.                         
            - Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                          
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.

            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.

            Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your      
            changes.                                                                                                
                                                                                                                    
            1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the           
            reproduction script again.                                                                              
              If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.    
              If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.                        
            2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).                                    
            3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started     
            fixing the issue.                                                                                       
              You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you  
            need to revert.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                          
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                          
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION

            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the

            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.

            recommendations.\nRemember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so     
            interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.\n\n1. You should show only one observation and

            The directory `/root/.gitconfig` exists with the permissions `drwxr-xr-x`, indicating that it is a      
            directory owned by `root`.                                                                              
                                                                                                                    
            To set ownership correctly, we should ensure that the file inside the directory is owned by the correct

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            ### User:                                                                                               
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the    
            previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                              
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, 
            and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.       
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands  
            like python or vim cannot be used.                                                                      
                                                                                                                    
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a     
            summary of the output of the previous command.                                                          
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.      
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct  
            directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT 
            create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context 
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like    
            python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                                
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                  
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                               
                                                                                                                    
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the 
            shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION     
            section will be saved for future reference.                                                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the
            first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the   
            special commands listed above.                                                                          
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do 
            not invoke them.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                    
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve    
            error or warning messages that may appear in it.
