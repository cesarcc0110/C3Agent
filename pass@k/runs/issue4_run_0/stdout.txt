            directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used  
            if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and 
            marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`     
            Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive   
            lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the
            replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The         
            `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above
            using bash and the special interface commands.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                                            
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY    
            important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish   
            this.                                                                                                               
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need,  
            use cd to move to a different directory.                                                                            
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                                             
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                                                
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file  
            where the problem is.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            WORKFLOW:                                                                                                           
            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                                     
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change      
            directories if needed.                                                                                              
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.                                                           
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

            - Run one command at a time.                                                                                        
            - Wait for feedback after each command.                                                                             
            - Do not use git or interactive tools.                                                                              
            - Use absolute paths when referencing files.                                                                        
            - If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.                                     
            - Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Based on the discussion, the most likely issue is that Java is not installed on the system. The commands to fix this
            have already been provided.

            **Discussion:**                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                
            * The command `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk` will install the OpenJDK 8 Java Development Kit (JDK) on the system. 
            * This JDK includes the Java runtime environment (JRE), the Java compiler, and other tools needed to develop and run
            Java applications.                                                                                                  
            * Once the JDK is installed, you will be able to run Java applications from the command line.                       
                                                                                                                                
            **Please note:**                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                
            * You will need to enter your password when prompted by the sudo command.                                           
            * This installation may take some time depending on your internet connection speed.                                 
                                                                                                                                
            **Additional Tips:**                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                
            * You can check if Java is installed by running the command `java -version` in the terminal.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Based on the discussion, the most likely issue is that Java is not installed on the system. The command provided in 
            the assistant message will fix this.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                
            **Command:**                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                
            **Discussion:**                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                
            * The command `sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk` will install the OpenJDK 8 Java Development Kit (JDK) on the system. 
            * This JDK includes the Java runtime environment (JRE), the Java compiler, and other tools needed to develop and run
            Java applications.                                                                                                  
            * Once the JDK is installed, you will be able to run Java applications from the command line.                       
                                                                                                                                
            **Please note:**                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                                
            * You will need to enter your password when prompted by the sudo command.                                           
            * This installation may take some time depending on your internet connection speed.                                 
                                                                                                                                
            **Additional Tips:**                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                
            * You can check if Java is installed by running the command `java -version` in the terminal.                        
            * You can also find more information about Java installation and configuration on the official Oracle website.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.

            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a

            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.

            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python

            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).

            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.
