            You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code   
            written in C++, Java and C.                                                                      
            You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files     
            directly.                                                                                        
                                                                                                             
            The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.       
            You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).

              docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent   
            across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the    
            result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and         
            directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path`    
            already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and      
            marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the 
            file at `path`                                                                                   
            Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or 
            more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str`     
            parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include 
            enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited
            lines that should replace the `old_str`

                - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a

            The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

            Incorrect midpoint calculation in Binary Search causing potential errors                         
            The midpoint in the binary search is calculated as `(left + right + 1) / 2`, which can cause     
            skipping of elements or out-of-bound errors in some cases.

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the   
            issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.                             
                                                                                                             
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                         
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the                
            <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various   
            tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this.                                          
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are     
            located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory.                                   
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                          
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                             
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly  
            or locate the file where the problem is.                                                         
                                                                                                             
            WORKFLOW:                                                                                        
            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                  
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use  
            `cd` to change directories if needed.                                                            
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.                                        
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

            - Wait for feedback after each command.                                                          
            - Do not use git or interactive tools.                                                           
            - Use absolute paths when referencing files.                                                     
            - If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.                  
            - Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of 
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned   
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or        
            recommendations.                                                                                 
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive    
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                      
                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                 
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new    
            one.                                                                                             
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the   
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                   
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. 
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it  
            in the context                                                                                   
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands  
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                        
                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response   
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                           
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit  
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second   
            command.                                                                                         
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to
            the special commands listed above.                                                               
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so    
            please do not invoke them.                                                                       
                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must   
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.                                           
            OBSERVATION:

            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second   
            command.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of 
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned   
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or        
            recommendations.                                                                                 
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive    
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.

            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new    
            one.

            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                   
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. 
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it  
            in the context

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of 
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned   
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or        
            recommendations.                                                                                 
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive    
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                      
                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                 
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new    
            one.                                                                                             
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the   
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                   
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. 
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it  
            in the context                                                                                   
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands  
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                        
                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response   
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                           
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit  
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second   
            command.                                                                                         
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to
            the special commands listed above.                                                               
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so    
            please do not invoke them.                                                                       
                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must   
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.                                           
            OBSERVATION:

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of 
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned   
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or        
            recommendations.                                                                                 
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive    
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                      
                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                 
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new    
            one.                                                                                             
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the   
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                   
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. 
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it  
            in the context                                                                                   
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands  
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                        
                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response   
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                           
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit  
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second   
            command.                                                                                         
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to
            the special commands listed above.                                                               
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so    
            please do not invoke them.                                                                       
                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must   
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.                                           
            OBSERVATION:                                                                                     
            The path BinarySearch.java is not an absolute path, it should start with `/`. Maybe you meant
