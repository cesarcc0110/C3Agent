            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface        
            commands.                                                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                                                                                         
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files,   
            there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this.                                                                                        
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory.      
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                                                                                          
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                                                                                             
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            WORKFLOW:                                                                                                                                                        
            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                                                                                  
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.                            
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.                                                                                                        
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

ü§† INFO     ü§ñ MODEL INPUT                                                                                                                                                   
            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:                                                                                                                                                     
            The path BinarySearch.java is not an absolute path, it should start with `/`.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script again.                                         
              If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.                                                             
              If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.                                                                                 
            2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).                                                                                             
            3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the issue.                                            
              You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to revert.                                           
            4.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.  
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your
            findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                                                                          
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.               
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                                         
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                                               
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you  
            want to edit.                                                                                                                                                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing    
            file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                                                                
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).                                    
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                                           
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                                             
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and         
            commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response      
            you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                                                                      
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.                             
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                                         
                                                                                                                                                                             
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.            
            OBSERVATION:
