            written in C++, Java and C.                                                                       
            You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files      
            directly.                                                                                         
                                                                                                              
            The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.        
            You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).

              docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent    
            across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the     
            result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and          
            directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path`     
            already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked
            with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at 
            `path`                                                                                            
            Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or  
            more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str`      
            parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include  
            enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited 
            lines that should replace the `old_str`

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the    
            issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.                              
                                                                                                              
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                          
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the                 
            <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various    
            tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this.                                           
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are      
            located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory.                                    
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                           
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                              
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or
            locate the file where the problem is.

            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                   
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use   
            `cd` to change directories if needed.                                                             
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.                                         
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

            - Wait for feedback after each command.                                                           
            - Do not use git or interactive tools.                                                            
            - Use absolute paths when referencing files.                                                      
            - If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.                   
            - Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            marks, and there's a missing semicolon at the end of the statement.                               
                                                                                                              
            ## Command                                                                                        
                                                                                                              
            This command attempts to replace the missing quotation marks and semicolon in the given file.     
                                                                                                              
            Please note that this command will only be submitted once you are confident it resolves the issue.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of  
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                    
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned    
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or         
            recommendations.                                                                                  
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive     
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                       
                                                                                                              
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be 
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                          
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the    
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move.  
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in
            the context                                                                                       
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands   
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                     
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                            
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                         
                                                                                                              
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response    
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the 
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit   
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second    
            command.                                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to 
            the special commands listed above.                                                                
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so     
            please do not invoke them.                                                                        
                                                                                                              
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must    
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of  
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                    
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned    
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or         
            recommendations.                                                                                  
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive     
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                       
                                                                                                              
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be 
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                          
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the    
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move.  
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in
            the context                                                                                       
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands   
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                     
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                            
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                         
                                                                                                              
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response    
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the 
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit   
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second    
            command.                                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to 
            the special commands listed above.                                                                
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so     
            please do not invoke them.                                                                        
                                                                                                              
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must    
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

            2. Unrecognized argument in the command.                                                          
                                                                                                              
            **Command:**                                                                                      
                                                                                                              
            ```                                                                                               
            str_replace_editor str_replace /HeberM69__Test_C3/HelloWorld.java --old_str                       
            "System.out.print(\"Hello, World\")" --new_str "System.out.print(\"Hello, World\")"               
            ```                                                                                               
                                                                                                              
            This command addresses both issues by correctly enclosing the string in quotation marks and       
            specifying the correct arguments.                                                                 
                                                                                                              
            **Discussion:**                                                                                   
                                                                                                              
            The updated command should now work successfully without any errors.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of  
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                    
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned    
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or         
            recommendations.                                                                                  
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive     
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                       
                                                                                                              
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be 
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                          
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the    
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move.  
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in
            the context                                                                                       
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands   
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                     
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                            
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                         
                                                                                                              
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response    
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the 
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit   
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second    
            command.                                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to 
            the special commands listed above.                                                                
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so     
            please do not invoke them.                                                                        
                                                                                                              
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must    
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.                                            
            OBSERVATION:

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of  
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                    
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned    
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or         
            recommendations.                                                                                  
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive     
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                       
                                                                                                              
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be 
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                          
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the    
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move.  
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in
            the context                                                                                       
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands   
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                     
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                            
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                         
                                                                                                              
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response    
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the 
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit   
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second    
            command.                                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to 
            the special commands listed above.                                                                
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so     
            please do not invoke them.                                                                        
                                                                                                              
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must    
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.                                            
            OBSERVATION:

            Based on the previous discussions, the user encountered two issues with the `str_replace_editor`  
            command:                                                                                          
                                                                                                              
            * Missing quotation marks around the string passed to `System.out.print`.                         
            * Incorrect arguments resulting in no replacement being performed.                                
                                                                                                              
            ## Final Command

            string in the file.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of  
            the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.                                    
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned    
            from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or         
            recommendations.                                                                                  
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive     
            commands like python or vim cannot be used.                                                       
                                                                                                              
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be 
            a summary of the output of the previous command.                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                          
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the    
            correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                    
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move.  
            Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in
            the context                                                                                       
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands   
            like python, vim, git, etc.).                                                                     
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                            
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                         
                                                                                                              
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response    
            from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the 
            DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                                            
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit   
            just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second    
            command.                                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to 
            the special commands listed above.                                                                
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so     
            please do not invoke them.                                                                        
                                                                                                              
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must    
            solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.                                            
            OBSERVATION:                                                                                      
            Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your
            changes.                                                                                          
                                                                                                              
            1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the     
            reproduction script again.                                                                        
              If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are       
            correct.                                                                                          
              If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.                  
            2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).                              
            3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you       
            started fixing the issue.                                                                         
              You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files
            you need to revert.                                                                               
            4. Run the submit command again to confirm.                                                       
                                                                                                              
            Here is a list of all of your changes:                                                            
                                                                                                              
            <diff>                                                                                            
                                                                                                              
            </diff>
