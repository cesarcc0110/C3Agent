              docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with  
            the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files  
            and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a         
            `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the    
            last edit made to the file at `path`                                                                                                      
            Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original 
            file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure 
            to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the
            `old_str`

            - Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.                                       
            - Code with incorrect indentation will fail.                                                                                              
            - You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.                        
            - If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello,   
            World!")', you should use the command:

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the   
            special interface commands.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                                                                  
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues   
            are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this.                                          
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a    
            different directory.                                                                                                                      
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                                                                   
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                                                                      
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.  
                                                                                                                                                      
            WORKFLOW:                                                                                                                                 
            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                                                           
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.     
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.

Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            - Ensure that the `BinarySearch.java` file is in the current directory.                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Conclusion:**                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
            The corrected command will successfully insert the missing line and fix the error in the `calculate()` method.                            
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Action:**

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after

            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are

            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            **Discussion:**                                                                                                                           
                                                                                                                                                      
            Based on the error message, it appears that the issue lies within the `--view_range` argument. The error message indicates that the       
            command expected two arguments, but only one was provided.                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Action:**                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. Check the usage of the `str_replace_editor` command to ensure that the `--view_range` argument is being used correctly.                
            2. Ensure that the line numbers provided in the `--view_range` argument are valid.                                                        
            3. Review the code for any typos or incorrect syntax in the `--view_range` argument.                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Example Command:**                                                                                                                      
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Note:**                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            * Replace `/HeberM69__Test_C3/BinarySearch.java` with the actual path to the `BinarySearch.java` file.                                    
            * The line numbers in the `--view_range` argument should be valid and correspond to the lines where you want to view the inserted line.   
                                                                                                                                                      
            **By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the error and use the `--view_range` argument correctly.**

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Based on the provided error messages, it appears that the issue lies with both the `--insert` and `--view_range` arguments.               
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Action:**

            **2. Valid `--view_range` Argument:**                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                      
            * Ensure the provided line numbers in the `--view_range` argument are valid and correspond to the lines where you want to view the        
            inserted line.

            **Note:**

            * Ensure the line numbers in the `--view_range` argument are valid.                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                      
            By addressing both issues and following the suggested commands, you should be able to resolve the errors and successfully edit the code.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.

Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Based on your updated information, it looks like you have correctly identified the issue with the `--view_range` argument. The start and  
            end line numbers are both invalid.                                                                                                        
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Action:**                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. Ensure both the start and end line numbers are within the bounds of the file.

            * The name and location of the file you are trying to edit.                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                      
            **Once you provide this information, I can confirm the command is ready to be executed.**

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission

            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.

Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may   
            appear in it.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission 
            that solve the error.                                                                                                                     
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and 
            a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                                                                           
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used. 
                                                                                                                                                      
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous 
            command.                                                                                                                                  
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                                                  
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                                        
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are      
            editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                                                                  
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are    
            correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                                                                  
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).             
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                                                    
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                      
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more 
            discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.                             
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after    
            receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                                                                          
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.      
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.                  
                                                                                                                                                      
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may
