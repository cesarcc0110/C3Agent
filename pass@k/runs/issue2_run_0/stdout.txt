            directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used  
            if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and 
            marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`     
            Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive   
            lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the
            replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The         
            `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

            In the Java implementation of Rectangle, the class is incomplete and does not contain a closing brace. This leads to
            a parsing error during compilation.

            You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above
            using bash and the special interface commands.                                                                      
                                                                                                                                
            Follow these steps to resolve the issue:                                                                            
            1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY    
            important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish   
            this.                                                                                                               
            2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need,  
            use cd to move to a different directory.                                                                            
            3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue                                                             
            4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well                                                
            5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file  
            where the problem is.                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            WORKFLOW:                                                                                                           
            1. Understand the PR ‚Äî Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.                                     
            2. Verify frequently ‚Äî Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change      
            directories if needed.                                                                                              
            3. Edit files ‚Äî Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.                                                           
            3. Do not install packages or push to remote ‚Äî Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

            - Run one command at a time.                                                                                        
            - Wait for feedback after each command.                                                                             
            - Do not use git or interactive tools.                                                                              
            - Use absolute paths when referencing files.                                                                        
            - If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.                                     
            - Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.                                                                             
            OBSERVATION:                                                                                                        
            The path Rectangle.java is not an absolute path, it should start with `/`. Maybe you meant

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.

            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.                                                                             
            OBSERVATION:                                                                                                        
            Thank you for your work on this issue. Please carefully follow the steps below to help review your changes.         
                                                                                                                                
            1. If you made any changes to your code after running the reproduction script, please run the reproduction script   
            again.                                                                                                              
              If the reproduction script is failing, please revisit your changes and make sure they are correct.                
              If you have already removed your reproduction script, please ignore this step.                                    
            2. Remove your reproduction script (if you haven't done so already).                                                
            3. If you have modified any TEST files, please revert them to the state they had before you started fixing the      
            issue.                                                                                                              
              You can do this with `git checkout -- /path/to/test/file.py`. Use below <diff> to find the files you need to      
            revert.                                                                                                             
            4. Run the submit command again to confirm.

            Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous       
            command to take a decission that solve the error.                                                                   
            Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then    
            compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.                            
            Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python  
            or vim cannot be used.                                                                                              
                                                                                                                                
            1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the  
            output of the previous command.                                                                                     
            2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.                                                            
            2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.                  
            3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or 
            the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.                                                           
               In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a    
            file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context                      
            5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim,   
            git, etc.).                                                                                                         
            7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.                                              
            8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes.                                                                           
                                                                                                                                
            You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before
            continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for    
            future reference.                                                                                                   
            If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first      
            command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.                            
            You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special       
            commands listed above.                                                                                              
            However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke  
            them.                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                
            Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or       
            warning messages that may appear in it.
