You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

## Discussion

Based on the PR description, the issue lies within the `Student.java` file. The missing closing brace has caused a compile-time error. Using the `str_replace_editor` tool, we can effectively locate and rectify this issue.

## Command

This command will search for lines containing a closing brace (`}`) in the `Student.java` file. It will then append a comment `(#)` immediately after the missing closing brace, effectively correcting the compile-time error.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
No replacement was performed, old_str `}` did not appear verbatim in /HeberM69__Test_C3/Student.java.

The syntax error is in the `setAverageGPA()` method. The `averageGPA` variable is not defined, and there is a missing closing parenthesis in the method signature.

## Command

```
str_replace_editor str_replace /HeberM69__Test_C3/Student.java --old_str "averageGPA" --new_str "averageGPA;"

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
The path /src/Student.java does not exist. Please provide a valid path.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
The path Student.java is not an absolute path, it should start with `/`. Maybe you meant /HeberM69__Test_C3/src/Student.java?

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
No replacement was performed, old_str `}` did not appear verbatim in /HeberM69__Test_C3/Student.java.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

The command `touch` creates an empty file named `Student.java` in the `/src` directory. This resolves the issue of missing files.

**Command:**

str_replace_editor insert /src/Student.java --insert_line 14 --new_str "}"

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
The path /src/Student.java does not exist. Please provide a valid path.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.

2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context

8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
The path /src/Student.java does not exist. Please provide a valid path.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
No replacement was performed, old_str `}` did not appear verbatim in /HeberM69__Test_C3/Student.java.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Based on the available file, the issue seems to be that the missing closing curly brace in the Student class. The corrected code should look like this:

```java
public class Student {
    private String name;
    private int age;

    public Student(String name, int age) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;

    }

    public int getAge() {
        return age;
    }

**Note:**
- This command will update the first occurrence of the missing closing curly brace in the file.
- If there are multiple occurrences, you may need to adjust the command accordingly.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command.

2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
The path /src/Student.java does not exist. Please provide a valid path.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file

  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
No replacement was performed, old_str `}` did not appear verbatim in /HeberM69__Test_C3/Student.java.

## Discussion

Based on the previous observation and the corrected issue description, it seems the issue is with the placement of the closing brace in the `Student.java` file. The missing brace might be located elsewhere in the file rather than at the end.

## Command

```
str_replace_editor str_replace /HeberM69__Test_C3/Student.java --old_str "}" --new_str "}}"
```

This command will look for and replace all occurrences of the closing brace (`}`) with a double closing brace (`}}`).

**Note:** If you encounter an error indicating "cannot find closing brace", it might mean there is no closing brace in the file and you need to add one at the end.

You are an expert AI that program autonomously and that will fix bugs and solve issues in code written in C++, Java and C.
You will be working in a command line with a special interface that allows you to edit files directly.

The special interface consists of a file editor that shows you  lines of a file at a time.
You are not allowed to use git or any interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
In addition to typical bash commands, you can also use the following commands to help you navigate and edit files.

COMMANDS:
bash:
  docstring: runs the given command directly in bash
  signature: <command>
  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The bash command to execute.

str_replace_editor:
  docstring: Custom editing tool for viewing, creating and editing files * State is persistent across command calls and discussions with the user * If `path` is a file, `view` displays the result of applying `cat -n`. If `path` is a directory, `view` lists non-hidden files and directories up to 2 levels deep * The `create` command cannot be used if the specified `path` already exists as a file * If a `command` generates a long output, it will be truncated and marked with `<response clipped>` * The `undo_edit` command will revert the last edit made to the file at `path`
Notes for using the `str_replace` command: * The `old_str` parameter should match EXACTLY one or more consecutive lines from the original file. Be mindful of whitespaces! * If the `old_str` parameter is not unique in the file, the replacement will not be performed. Make sure to include enough context in `old_str` to make it unique * The `new_str` parameter should contain the edited lines that should replace the `old_str`

  signature: str_replace_editor <command> <path> [<file_text>] [<view_range>] [<old_str>] [<new_str>] [<insert_line>]

  arguments:
    - command (string) [required]: The commands to run. Allowed options are: `view`, `create`, `str_replace`, `insert`, `undo_edit`.
    - path (string) [required]: Absolute path to file or directory, e.g. `/testbed/file.py` or `/testbed`.
    - file_text (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `create` command, with the content of the file to be created.
    - old_str (string) [optional]: Required parameter of `str_replace` command containing the string in `path` to replace.
    - new_str (string) [optional]: Optional parameter of `str_replace` command containing the new string (if not given, no string will be added). Required parameter of `insert` command containing the string to insert.
    - insert_line (integer) [optional]: Required parameter of `insert` command. The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.
    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.

submit:
  docstring: submits the current file
  signature: submit



  RULES ON EDITING:
- Indentation is critical. To add the line '        print(x)', you must include all spaces exactly.
- Code with incorrect indentation will fail.
- You should only edit the files that are necessary to fix the issue described in the PR, do not create new files.
- If you want to modify asinge character, substitute all the line with the new line, e.g., to change 'print("Hello")' to 'print("Hello, World!")', you should use the command:
  ```
str_replace_editor str_replace /src/example.py --old_str 'print("Hello")' --new_str 'print("Hello, World!")'
  ```

  RESPONSE FORMAT:
Your output must include exactly:

1. DISCUSSION â€” A very SHORT and CONCISE explanation of your reasoning. 
2. COMMAND â€” ONLY A SINGLE command

An example of the response format you must follow is:

DISCUSSION
I'll begin by listing all files in the directory to get an overview.

COMMAND
```
ls -a
```

Do NOT run multiple commands at once.
Do NOT combine multiple commands in a single submission.
Do NOT use interactive commands (e.g., python, vim).
Do NoT use git or any version control commands.
Do NOT create new files or directories.

The issue you're working on is described in the following PR:

<pr_description>
Student.java
In the Java implementation of Student, the class is not properly closed with a closing brace (}). This causes a compile-time error due to an unexpected end of file.

File: Student.java

</pr_description>

You are now in the root of the repository at `/HeberM69__Test_C3`. Your task is to resolve the issue described above using bash and the special interface commands.

Follow these steps to resolve the issue:
1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>. This is VERY important. Most issues are in EXISTING files, there are various tools and bash commands you can use to accomplish this. 
2. Run `ls -a` to see the files in the current directory, and `pwd` to confirm where you are located. If you need, use cd to move to a different directory. 
3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue
4. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well
5. Read what all of your tools do! One of them might be the key you need to do an edit properly or locate the file where the problem is.

WORKFLOW:
1. Understand the PR â€” Use the description to infer which file(s) need editing.
2. Verify frequently â€” Use `pwd`, `ls`, and always confirm you're editing the correct file. use `cd` to change directories if needed.
3. Edit files â€” Use `str_replace_editor` to make changes.
3. Do not install packages or push to remote â€” Use only `submit` to finalize your changes.

REMINDERS:
- Run one command at a time.
- Wait for feedback after each command.
- Do not use git or interactive tools.
- Use absolute paths when referencing files.
- If you encounter an error or warning, analyze it and take appropriate action.
- Use `submit` to finalize your changes.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
OBSERVATION:
No replacement was performed, old_str `}` did not appear verbatim in /HeberM69__Test_C3/Student.java.

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.

The command should now successfully replace all occurrences of the character `}` with the character `}` in the specified file.

## Command

Remember that you are the autonomous programmer, and you need to carefully analyze the output of the previous command to take a decission that solve the error.
Before executing another command, carefully analyze the output, reflect on what you've learned from it, and then compose a discussion and a command based on your findings, warnings, or recommendations.
Remember, the commands are limited to bash or special interface commands only, so interactive commands like python or vim cannot be used.

1. You should show only one observation and ACTION ONE COMMAND AT TIME, the observation should be a summary of the output of the previous command. 
2. You need to action the command, not only disscuss it.
2. Wait for the model to respond with the output of the previous command before running a new one.
3. If you receive and answer about a wrong path or a missing file, it means you are not in the correct directory or the file you are editing is not the one you want to edit.
   In that case, use `pwd` and `ls -a` to check if you are in the correct folder and cd to move. Do NOT create a file, remeber you are correcting an existing file and I give you the path to it in the context
5. Remember which are the allowed commands and how to use them (no interactive session commands like python, vim, git, etc.).
7. If you are not sure about the next step, review the previous steps.
8. Use `submit` to finalize your changes. 

You should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.
If you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.
You're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.
However, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.

Pay attention to the observation, it is the output of the previous command and it and you must solve error or warning messages that may appear in it.
